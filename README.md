# A React 2-D Physics Library

### Motivation
The intention for this project is to provide a common set of tools for creating a perpetually animated HTML element that is wrapped by a React functional component.

In other words, we can add 2-D physics to HTML elements and actively simulate it in the browser. 

For the programmer, a typical usage of the library would involve using one of the many built-in functional components part of the library (or perhaps I can find a way to build components dynamically?). For now, HTML elments are animated based on how pre-defined React components work. Visit [here](###code-example) for a code example.

### Supported HTML Elements
- <svg> with a <rect> element within via <AnimatedRect> functional component.

### Compiling, Testing, and Serving an Example App
View the package.json to view all the necessary scripts.
Additionally, there is a Playwright e2e test suite run by invoking the `npx playwright test` command.
My playwright tests depend on the `serve` library, so install `serve` (I did it globally for my system).

For reference, you can view my publically available GitLab CI / CD pipeline to learn how to run unit tests and playwright tests on a node 18 docker image (runs on Linux, but with some minor tweaks I've tested it on Windows, too).
